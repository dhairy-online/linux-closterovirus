## Closterovirus 
#### I don't know what I'm doing :rofl:


### Steps to use this virus (Although won't recommend in future?) :

Option 1) Clone the repository:

 ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/dhairy-online/linux-closterovirus
  ```
  After this go to the folder
  ```bash
  cd linux-closterovirus/
  ```
  
  #### Using the virus
  
  You can do this if you have cargo:
  
   ```bash
      cargo run
   ```
    
  Option 2) Directly installing the virus
  
  I will be releasing the virus with the binary file.
  
  So When I do that do this:
  
  Download the file, And do 
  ```bash
  chmod +x ./<FILE_NAME>
  ```
  And then simply run:
  ```bash
   ./<FILE_NAME>
  ```
  Replace the <FILE_NAME> with the downloaded file's name
